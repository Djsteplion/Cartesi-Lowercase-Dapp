# Cartesi-Lowercase-Dapp

🔵This dapp was built using the cartesi rollups technology.The dapp converts strings to lowercase. This was achieved using cartesi backend rollup apis (report and notice).The entry point of this application is the index.js file.

🔵According to the cartesi documentation, a notice is a verifiable data declaration that attests to off-chain events or conditions and is accompanied by proof.It also provides a mechanism to communicate essential off-chain events in the execution layer to the base layer in a verifiable manner  WHILE reports are stateless logs, offering a means to record read-only information without changing the state.


# Installation

🔹️nodejs, npm, yarn
